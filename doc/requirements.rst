Requirements
============

To use genapp, for either deploying applications or developing plugins, you
need the following software installed:

**Erlang**
  genapp is designed to work with earlier versions of Erlang. If the version of
  Erlang that's available for your system doesn't work, please :doc:`concact
  CloudBees <contact>` with the details and we'll help you resolve them.

**make**
  genapp requires that ``make`` is installed to build the source code. This is
  usually provided by the system package of the same name.

**python** (optional for quick start example)
  If you follow the :doc:`quick start <quickstart>` example, you'll need Python
  to run the deployed application.
